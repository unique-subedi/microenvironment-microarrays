# Microenvironment-Microarrays
Broadly, we want to better understand the mechanism of cancer cell growth by studying cell's micronevironment. A cell's microenvironment consists of the local collection of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, growth factors, chemokines, citokines, and other cellular structures that surround cells in a tissue. The microenvironment includes structural components (e.g., collagen) as well as biochemical / signaling components.
In particular, the goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis on microenvironment data. The goal is insight -- into the data, into the experimental methodology, and into the science.
